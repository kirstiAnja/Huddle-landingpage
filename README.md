### What I learned
In this project I worked with flex and grid. I am still not quite comfortable when it comes to knowing when/where to use it. Still trying to figure out the difference between them. 
I've used color filter converter to change color on icons when focus state activ.
I am still trying different ways to make the page reaponsive.

### Continued development
Centering using grid/flex, Responsiveness and layout are areas that I will continiue focusing on.
Continiue practice the basics, building muscle memory..
